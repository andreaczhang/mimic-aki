### Ask questions

First need to know what to do, not blindly do plots. Two types of questions: 

- variation occurs within each variable
- covariation occurs between each variable



## variations

### visualise distributions

barplot vs histogram: I think barplot is histogram for discrete values. 



#### typical values 

- most frequent, rarest
- max, min

- clusters (bi/trimodal), and explore why they tend to cluster 



#### unusual values (outliers)

#### missing values (and imputation)



## covariations

**scatter plot** (continuous vs continuous)

**boxplot** (discrete vs continuous). interquartile range (25 to 75%)

**Heat map** or **grid** (with different size for pairs of x-y) (discrete vs discrete)

Note that the type of data is not absolute, for example we can also use boxplot for continuous data.
